## [Wiki](https://github.com/softwerkskammer/softwerkskammer-rhein-main-wiki/wiki) of the [Softwerkskammer Rhein-Main](http://www.softwerkskammer.org/groups/rheinmain)


This repo serves as the (possibly preliminary and temporary) [Wiki](https://github.com/softwerkskammer/softwerkskammer-rhein-main-wiki) for the [Softwerkskammer Rhein-Main](http://www.softwerkskammer.org/groups/rheinmain), a group of software enthusiasts, who want to make the software world a better place. 

This repo serves as a replacement for an "old" system used by the Softwerkskammer groups, where Wiki functionality was available. But since the Softwerkskammer groups have moved to a new software platform in August 2013, a Wiki is no longer  (at least for now) part of the software platform used to manage the groups.

Go to the [Wiki](https://github.com/softwerkskammer/softwerkskammer-rhein-main-wiki)-tab of this repo to actually view (and possibly edit) the Wiki.
